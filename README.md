This is what the section that we worked on looked like wqhen you first clicked into it. It connects to a Microsoft SQL Server via Java RESTful endpoints and returned by HTTP requests within the Angular project to perform CRUD operations. I believe the Java backend was set up using Spring Boot to allow the HTTP requests to interact with the SQL server.

This is the add new dialog that would pop up when users clicked the add new button. Upon clicking save the assignment would be entered into the SQL databse via a POST request.

If you select a row, this dialog will pop up allowing the user to edit the entry and view the change history of that given entry. The updated entry would be returned via a PUT request.

This is what the view history tab looks like. This data displayed is also taken from an SQL databse that saves all updates made to a given entry.
